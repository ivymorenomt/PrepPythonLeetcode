## Notes

This repo is intended for my personal notes and preparation for interviews and Leetcode grinding.

At the time of this writing, I am a Manual QA Tester. The reason behind Leetcode grinding is to help me explore and able to answer technical interviews,but, mostly, my studies (I am currently in my second year of my grad school. 20 more units to go!!).
