## Notes

This repo is intended for my personal notes and preparation for interviews and Leetcode grinding.

Leetcode would not only help me with interviews, but it would also help me with my current job(At the time of this writing, I am a Manual QA Tester) and my studies (I am currently in my second year of my grad school. 20 more units to go!!).
