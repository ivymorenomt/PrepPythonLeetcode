### Lists
What is a List? It is a collec tion or grouping of items.
This is also known as Array in other languages.

It is a fundamental data structure for organizing collections of items.

A list should look like this:
```
    tasks = ['Install Python', 'Learn Python', 'Take a Break']
```
We can have a string, a boolean, or integers in the list.

**len** - this is used to find out how many elements or items are there in a list.
This is very useful when looping in a list. We need to know how many elements are there to loop.

**range** - this is a built in function used to make a list.

```
    r = (1,10) # this is going to create a sequence from 1 - 9
    list(r)
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```
When we do list on a range, it will give us a list of a range. We are not only using range to loop thru items, but we can also convert a range of numbers to a list.
