Some problem [solving strategies](https://dev.to/moresaltmorelemon/algorithm-problem-solving-strategies-21cp).

**NOTE**: Before solving, do the following:
#### Think
1. Analyze the problem
2. Restate the problem
3. Write out examples of input and output.
4. Create positive test cases to cover possibilities 
5. Break the problem into its component parts
6. OUtline a solution in pseudo-code
7. Step through your example data with your pseudo-code

#### Execute
1. Code
2. Test your solutions against your test case
3. Refactor
